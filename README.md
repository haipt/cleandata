#About
This Project is for the Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data Project
The folder contains both the [R] script and the necessary input data files
The input data files should be put inside the data folder.

##Prerequisites
R version 3.1.2 or above with package dplyr installed. 

#Running
The [R] script is run_analysis.R
You can run the script inside your R console by changing the working directory to the folder (setwd(...)), then type
source('run_analysis.R')
It will take sometimes to run (about 10s - 20s on my laptop).
Once the script finishes running, tt should generate the output file 'clean.txt', which contains the cleaned data from the inputs.
