The output file from the script is in the file clean.txt.
It should contains 180 observations (6 activities per subject, for 30 subjects)of 81 variables.
The observations are listed in order of subject (each subject is a person).
After Subject and Activity, the other 79 variables are:
    "tBodyAcc-mean-X" "tBodyAcc-mean-Y" "tBodyAcc-mean-Z" "tBodyAcc-std-X" "tBodyAcc-std-Y" "tBodyAcc-std-Z" "tGravityAcc-mean-X" "tGravityAcc-mean-Y" "tGravityAcc-mean-Z" "tGravityAcc-std-X" "tGravityAcc-std-Y" "tGravityAcc-std-Z" "tBodyAccJerk-mean-X" "tBodyAccJerk-mean-Y" "tBodyAccJerk-mean-Z" "tBodyAccJerk-std-X" "tBodyAccJerk-std-Y" "tBodyAccJerk-std-Z" "tBodyGyro-mean-X" "tBodyGyro-mean-Y" "tBodyGyro-mean-Z" "tBodyGyro-std-X" "tBodyGyro-std-Y" "tBodyGyro-std-Z" "tBodyGyroJerk-mean-X" "tBodyGyroJerk-mean-Y" "tBodyGyroJerk-mean-Z" "tBodyGyroJerk-std-X" "tBodyGyroJerk-std-Y" "tBodyGyroJerk-std-Z" "tBodyAccMag-mean" "tBodyAccMag-std" "tGravityAccMag-mean" "tGravityAccMag-std" "tBodyAccJerkMag-mean" "tBodyAccJerkMag-std" "tBodyGyroMag-mean" "tBodyGyroMag-std" "tBodyGyroJerkMag-mean" "tBodyGyroJerkMag-std" "fBodyAcc-mean-X" "fBodyAcc-mean-Y" "fBodyAcc-mean-Z" "fBodyAcc-std-X" "fBodyAcc-std-Y" "fBodyAcc-std-Z" "fBodyAcc-meanFreq-X" "fBodyAcc-meanFreq-Y" "fBodyAcc-meanFreq-Z" "fBodyAccJerk-mean-X" "fBodyAccJerk-mean-Y" "fBodyAccJerk-mean-Z" "fBodyAccJerk-std-X" "fBodyAccJerk-std-Y" "fBodyAccJerk-std-Z" "fBodyAccJerk-meanFreq-X" "fBodyAccJerk-meanFreq-Y" "fBodyAccJerk-meanFreq-Z" "fBodyGyro-mean-X" "fBodyGyro-mean-Y" "fBodyGyro-mean-Z" "fBodyGyro-std-X" "fBodyGyro-std-Y" "fBodyGyro-std-Z" "fBodyGyro-meanFreq-X" "fBodyGyro-meanFreq-Y" "fBodyGyro-meanFreq-Z" "fBodyAccMag-mean" "fBodyAccMag-std" "fBodyAccMag-meanFreq" "fBodyBodyAccJerkMag-mean" "fBodyBodyAccJerkMag-std" "fBodyBodyAccJerkMag-meanFreq" "fBodyBodyGyroMag-mean" "fBodyBodyGyroMag-std" "fBodyBodyGyroMag-meanFreq" "fBodyBodyGyroJerkMag-mean" "fBodyBodyGyroJerkMag-std" "fBodyBodyGyroJerkMag-meanFreq"

Variables that have name starting with t (e.g. tBodyAcc-mean-X) are measured in time-domain. Variables that has name starting with 'f' are calculated in frequency-domain.

Each variable is caculated as average of the the values from multiple observations from the input data for that subject and activity.
